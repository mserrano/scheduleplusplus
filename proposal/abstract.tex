This document is a proposal to create a replacement Carnegie Mellon class scheduling website.
This website will differ from other existing websites in that it will consistently be up-to-date and 
include information such as class description, in addition to allowing students to automatically
generate schedules based on a list of preferences and priorities. The website will take into account
student desires to produce a schedule that is near-optimal for the student.
This proposal gives an outline of how we plan to complete the project, including a project schedule and our
plan for how to approach the problem.
