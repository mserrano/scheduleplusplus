\section{Evaluation}
We can evaluate the success of this project in five ways. First, the website
should always have an up-to-date list of classes based on Schedule Of Classes,
the official CMU website where class meeting times are posted. Second, the site
must be able to generate schedules that fit the largest possible number of
classes from a list given by a user. Third, the schedules that the site
generates should seem reasonable to users and match other constraints (such as
time to wake up and length of breaks) as well as possible. Fourth, the search
results the site gives should be useful and high-quality. Finally, the site
should be easy to use.

Our goal is to have a fully-functioning website by the third week of November,
though we expect to have basic functionality working before then.  We can test
the objective evaluation criteria as we go to ensure that the site is working
as expected and will test the more subjective points by asking for people to
test the site and give us feedback on it. We have allocated at least three weeks
to work primarily on polishing the user interface of the website based on the
feedback we receive from users who test it for us.
