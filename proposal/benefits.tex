\section{Benefits}
This project will benefit both the team working in it and users of the website.

The people working on this project will benefit by gaining experience in
creating websites, specifically in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
Python, and SQL and in using libraries such as Flask and Bootstrap.  Group
members will also gain experience in working on building large projects from the
ground up.

Users of the website will benefit from being able to more quickly plan out
schedules and change them if their initial plans don't work.  Users will also
be able to evaluate many different schedules while picking classes for future
semesters, allowing them to ensure they leave room for all of the classes they
want to take.
