There are currently a few websites that CMU students use to manage, plan, and
share their schedules. The three most commonly used are SIO, ScheduleMan, and
SchedulePlus. These websites each have disadvantages. SIO lacks any ability to
share your schedules with friends, ScheduleMan's ability to search for courses
is very limited, and many features of SchedulePlus rely on users logging in with
a Facebook account.  None of the sites offer features to help you plan
a schedule.

We plan to improve on these limitations by creating a website that allows you
to: search for classes by number, instructor, title, and description; easily
share of schedules; and automatically plan out schedules given a list of courses.
