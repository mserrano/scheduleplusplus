\section{Overview}
\subsection{Purpose of the Report}
  This report describes the state of our work on Schedule++. It details the
  progress that we have made as compared to the projections we made in our
  proposal. This report also details the changes we had to make to our proposed
  schedule in order to complete the project by our deadline of December 8.

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
  Schedule++ is intended to provide a better scheduling app for members of the
  CMU community. It will allow the standard features (like searching
  for classes and manually putting schedules together) that current scheduling
  websites offer. We will augment this by allowing users to search class
  descriptions, and also will optionally generate schedules for a user based
  on a list of classes they want to take (with priorities for how important
  each class is to them). These generated schedules will respect restrictions
  that the students have, such as ``I don't want to wake up before 10 AM, I want
  a consistent lunchtime, and I want between 45 and 54 units.''
  Given a user's constraints and desires, the website will give the user a list
  of potential schedules to decide between.
