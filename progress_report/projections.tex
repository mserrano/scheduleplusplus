\section{Projections}
Given our current project state, we have revised our schedule as follows:

As demonstrated in our revised chart and as discussed previously, we have
completed the basic components of both the front and backend. We have also
made enough progress on the data scraping so that the rest of the work which
is needed on the backend consists of finishing the optimization algorithm and
creating the API for the backend code. Thanks to the time initially
allocated to getting the schedule optimizer working, the backend team is
currently slightly ahead of schedule. This is good news, as it will
give them an opportunity to create the best possible scheduling algorithm.

Our frontend has team has somewhat more left to do: although the frontend group
has a barebones UI working, there still exists considerable work required
before the user-facing site and user experience (UX) will be complete.
The frontend team is currently on-schedule to finish as expected initially,
and will hopefully be able to pull ahead of schedule as work on the UI
progresses.

The final week is reserved for polishing and debugging the site, giving us 
time to test and make sure everything is perfect before we release it to the 
public.  During this time (and any extra time resulting form being ahead of
schedule), we will bring the site from a functional but ugly or buggy state
to a well-polished application.

Overall, the impact of the minor setbacks we've experienced will be minimal,
and we expect to still be able to deliver the same useful, high quality
webapp as promised.
